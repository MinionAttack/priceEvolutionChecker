# priceEvolutionChecker
Simple script on `Python 3` to scraping the product prices of a web and export them to a `CSV`.

The original idea was to scrap the prices of PCComponentes but they use Cloudfare cache and I got all the time an `206 Partial Content` code so I decided to try the MediaMarkt website and it worked.

I keep the ID's of the brands and products of PCComponentes as they took me a lot of time to obtain. I only have tested the *Motherboards* on *MediaMarkt* but the structure was made to add more ID's on an easy way.
